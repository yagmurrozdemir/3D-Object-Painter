# 3D-Object-Painter

The objective of this project is to create a 3D object painter application that utilizes a graph data structure to color the vertices of a given 3D object. To achieve this goal, I have implemented a graph data structure that holds the 3D object, along with multiple painting methods.

One of the primary tasks in implementing this application is to construct a graph data structure that can efficiently store and manipulate the vertices of the 3D object. I have utilized the shortest path algorithm to determine the optimal coloring of the vertices, and to achieve this I have implemented my own binary heap data structure.
